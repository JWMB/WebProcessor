## How can I increase my training quota?
For each training that has completed at least 5 training days, your training quota (the number of trainings you can create) increases by 1.

## How do I install the training app?

Currently, the training app is not available for installing from App Store or Google Play Store.

You can access the app from a browser at Training app page

In order to make the app feel more like a native app, you can enable Progressive Web App (PWA) mode by following these instructions: https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/05/24/how-install-progressive-web-app-pwa-android-ios-pc-mac/

## Can other teachers create accounts?

The training program is currently only available to a small group of invited users.

We are investigating options for making it publicly available.

## What do the bars in the training view mean?

The training statistics algorithms have not yet been finalized. We will be updating this article soon!

## Why is there a limit on the number of trainings I can create?

The training is now done from a web browser, instead of from an installed app.

This may cause problems in some schools, and since our capacity to provide support is low, we have limited the number of trainings that any one teacher can create.

For every training that has completed at least 5 days, your training quota will increase by 1.

## Where can I sign up colleagues?

Currently, we are only allowing a fairly low number of teachers and trainings in our system.

We are looking into making the program publicly available, but we don't see it happening until the second half of 2023 at the earliest.

## About the project

We are pleased to announce that Vektor is being resurrected this spring with the help of research funding from a Wallenberg Foundation and based in the Karolinska Institutet.

A group of selected teachers have received invitations to participate, because they have previously been successful users of the program. They can administer their training through the Teacher admin page.

 

The app looks and works just like before - however you access it via login on a website (Training app page), not through an app installed through Apples App Store or Google Play.

As before, it will contain the training schedule that we found best based on previous research. We will also vary a few percent of the time in order to make the app even better in the future through analyses.

 

We will not save any personal data from the users of the training app, and the use of the app is approved by the Ethics Review Authority.
