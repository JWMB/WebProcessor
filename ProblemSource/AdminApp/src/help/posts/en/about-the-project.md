We are pleased to announce that Vektor is being resurrected this spring with the help of research funding from a Wallenberg Foundation and based in the Karolinska Institutet.
A group of selected teachers have received invitations to participate, because they have previously been successful users of the program. They can administer their training through the Teacher admin page.

The app looks and works just like before - however you access it via login on a website (Training app page), not through an app installed through Apples App Store or Google Play.
As before, it will contain the training schedule that we found best based on previous research. We will also vary a few percent of the time in order to make the app even better in the future through analyses.

We will not save any personal data from the users of the training app, and the use of the app is approved by the Ethics Review Authority.
